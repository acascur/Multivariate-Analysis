# Multivariate-Analysis
In this repository we can find the theory and the Python code for the multivariate analysis part of the course "Advanced Computational Physics" 
of the Master in Physics of the University of Santiago de Compostela. 
**Note: All these programs are made without using any python statistics library.**

## Exercise 0

A program that given a set of data $(x_1, y_1), ..., (x_n , y_n )$ read from a file:
1. evaluates $mean(x)$, $mean(y)$, $\sigma_x$ , $\sigma_y$ , and the correlation
coefficient, $\rho$.
2. defines two functions $f_y(x)$ and $f_x(y)$ such that given $x$ (respectively $y$) evaluates the best possible choice of $y$
(respectively $x$) compatible with the above data.
3. Plot the data points. Plot the two lines.

In this program we use the data in file **test0.dat** *(You can find this file in the datasets folder)*.
